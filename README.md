# extracting-brain-boundaries-from-rs-fMRI-data
We will extract the brain boundaries from the resting state functional magnetic resonance  imaging (rs-fMRI) scans

We will be able to:
● Extract brain slices from the data set.
● Extract the brain boundary (periphery) from those slices.

In this project we will work on rs-fmri data. rs-fMRI is a functional magnetic resonance imaging which is done 
to evaluate the functional connectivity in the brain networks when the patient is in resting state. Patient’s brain
evaluation is done based on the blood consumption activations (shown as red clusters in figure 1) in different 
regions of the brain. These clusters reflect the changes in brain’s activity which are driven by the active areas of 
human body. The fMRI data is usually a 4D data and it is further decomposed into spatial independent 
components (ICs) using MELODIC software.
